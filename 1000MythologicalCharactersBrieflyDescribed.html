<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>The front cover has been created by the transcriber for the convenience
of the reader. The front cover is released into the public domain.</p>

<p>For ease of searching, names with a syllabic accent mark have been
included initially without that accent, and all ligatures have been
expanded (e.g. � has become ae). Further, proper nouns in the main
body of the text (but not in the quoted material) have been made
consistent where there was either a definite typographic error or there
was a clear prevalence of one form over another. A list of these changes
may be found at the end of the text.</p>

<p>There were some instances of valid variable spellings
which have been preserved as printed in each case. These include:
Adrastaea, Adrasteia; Dionysus, Dionysius; Galatea, Galataea;
Nemean, Nemaean; Perithous, Pirithous. The book also uses some
archaic spelling, and this is also preserved as printed.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>There are many expressions which, though
simple in themselves, must forever remain
beyond the grasp of human comprehension.
Eternity, that which has neither end nor beginning,
baffles the most profound human
thought. It is impossible to think of a point
beyond which there is absolutely nothing, or
to imagine the passing of a million years
without bringing us one day or one minute
nearer to their close. Suppose that one
could fix upon the terminal point, we would
still fancy something beyond that, and then
some period still more remote would present
itself, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>The same insurmountable difficulty confronts
us when we seek to imagine a First
Cause. God was the beginning, and yet it
seems to our finite minds, that something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
must have brought Him into existence,
and we conclude that back again of that creating
Power must have been another originating
cause, and perhaps still another, and
so on without limitation.</p>

<p>And yet we know that there must have
been a period when everything was void, or,
in other words, when there was nothing. In
the awful grandeur of that loneliness, desolation,
and chaos, God we know, however,
existed and called the universe into being.
All that we, in our present finite condition,
can ever comprehend of that stupendous birth
is contained in the opening of the first chapter
of Genesis.</p>

<p>That is the story of the creation as told by
God Himself to His chosen people, the Hebrews,
they alone being selected from the
nations then existing upon the earth to receive
the wonderful revelation.</p>

<p>Every people, no matter how degraded
and sunken in barbarism, has some perception,
some explanation of, and a more or less
well-grounded belief in, a First Cause. Far
back among the mists of antiquity, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
remotest beginnings of the shadowy centuries,
sits enthroned a Being, who in His infinite
might and power brought mankind,
the universe, and all animate and inanimate
things into existence, and who rewards those
of His children who do His will, and punishes
those who disobey His commands.
That will, as interpreted by believers, is as
various in its application to the conduct of
man as are the standards of right and wrong
among the civilized and even among the
barbarous nations of to-day. What is virtue
with one is vice with the other, as beauty
and ugliness of form or feature, being relative
terms, are opposites with many different
peoples.</p>

<p>Since the Greeks and Romans were not
among those who received the divine story
of creation, they were forced to devise a theory
to explain their own existence and account
for the origin of all things. The
foundation of this theory lay in the marvelous
phenomena of nature around them.
The growth of the mighty tree from the tiny
seed, the bursting bud and blossom, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
changing hues and the fragrance of flowers,
the alternation of day and night, the flash of
the rock-rending lightning, the rage of the
tempest, the flow of the rivers; the towering
mountains, the lovely valleys; dew, rain,
the clouds, and the ever-shifting panorama
on every hand; the majestic sweep of the
blazing worlds through space�all these
pointed unerringly to a First Cause, which
originally launched them into being, and
maintains the constant order of things and
the miraculous procession of the planets and
the orderly succession of the seasons in obedience
to laws that know no change.</p>

<p>To the Greeks and Romans, there was a
time more remote than history gives us any
account of, when there was neither land nor
water, and when the earth and all things
within and upon it were �without form and
void.� Over that misty, nebulous mixing
and mingling brooded the god Chaos, who
shared his throne with Nox, the goddess of
night. From this union the innumerable
myths gradually sprang up and developed,
which in their own imaginative though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
often grotesque way explained the various
phases of creation. These finally became
crystallized into a literature, or mythology,
which has since been the inspiration alike
of romancers and poets.</p>

<p>The most learned of mythologists differ in
their analysis of the multitude of myths that
have descended to us. Their varying analyses,
however, may be separated into two distinct
classes or divisions, each of which has
its own adherents and supporters.</p>

<p>The first school is that of the philologists,
and the second that of the anthropologists,
or comparative mythologists.</p>

<p>Philology relates to the study of language,
especially when treated in a philosophical
manner. This school maintains that the
myths had their origin in a �disease of the
language, as the pearl is a result of a disease
of the oyster.� The key, therefore, to all
mythologies, they say, is found in language.
The names originally applied to the gods
generally referred to the phenomena of the
clouds, winds, rain, sunshine, etc. Latin,
Greek, and Sanskrit, the great languages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
antiquity, they demonstrate, had their foundation
in a single source which is still older.
As further proof of their position, they point
to the similarity in the most ordinary words
in the various languages of the same family,
and show that they have undergone few or
very trifling changes.</p>

<p>The greatest authority among the philologists
claims that during the �first period�
there was a tribe in Central Asia, whose
language consisted of one-syllable words,
which contained the germs of the Turanian,
Aryan, and Semitic tongues. This age is
termed the Rhematic period, and was succeeded
by the Nomadic or Agglutinative
age, during which the language gradually
�received, once for all, that peculiar impress
of their formative system which we still find
in all the dialects and national idioms comprised
under the name of Aryan or Semitic,�
which includes over three thousand dialects.</p>

<p>The same authority follows the Agglutinative
period with one �represented everywhere
by the same characteristic features,
called the Mythological, or Mythopoeic age.�</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
As the name implies, this last-mentioned
period saw the evolution and development of
mythic lore. As do the American Indians of
to-day, so primitive man, in his crude way,
explained the operation of physical laws by
giving to inanimate objects like passions and
sentiments with himself. When the tempest
rages, and the crashing lightning splinters
the mountain oak, the Indian says that
the Great Spirit is angry. When nature becomes
serene and calm, the Great Spirit is
pleased. The malign forces around him,
which work ill to the warrior, are, they say,
the direct doings of an evil spirit. Even the
heavenly bodies are personified, and �poetry
has so far kept alive in our minds the old
animative theory of nature, that it is no
great effort in us to fancy the waterspout a
huge giant or sea-monster, and to depict, in
what we call appropriate metaphor, its march
across the field of ocean.�</p>

<p>Since the names of the Greek heroes and
gods show a general correspondence with the
Sanskrit appellations of physical things, it is
comparatively easy to understand many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
the first fancies and reflections of the earliest
men who ever lived. It is the argument of
the philologists that these fancies and reflections
settled into definite shape in that far-away
period when most of the nations, now
spread to the remotest corners of the earth,
dwelt together and used a common language.
Following the gradual scattering of this single,
unified people, the language became sensitive
to the change, many words not only
losing their original meaning, but, in some
instances, acquiring an opposite significance.
Other words, again, in the course of time
were utterly lost. �As long as such personified
beings as the Heaven or the Sun are
consciously talked of in mythic language,
the meaning of their legends is open to no
question, and the action ascribed to them
will, as a rule, be natural and appropriate.�
The time came, however, when these names
were considered simply as applying to heroes
or deities, and amid the jumble and confusion
of the succeeding ages it became well-nigh
impossible to trace the myths back to
their original source and meaning. Such is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
a brief outline of the myth interpretations,
as made by the philologists.</p>

<p>Anthropology may be defined as the study
of man, considered in his entire nature. In
explaining mythology, the anthropologists
say that �it is man, it is human thought and
human language combined, which naturally
and necessarily produced the strange conglomerate
of ancient fable.� Instead, therefore,
of seeking the source of myths in language,
the second class find it in the �condition
of thought through which all races have
passed.�</p>

<p>The argument of the anthropologists is that
while all nations have come from one parent-stock,
as is claimed also by the philologists,
yet the various peoples, in their primitive
or savage state, have passed through a
like low intellectual condition and growth.
The folk-lore of all countries shows that the
savages consider themselves of the same nature
as beasts, and regard �even plants, inanimate
objects, and the most abstract phenomena
as persons with human parts and
passions.� Every religion antedating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
Christianity has inculcated the worship of idols,
which usually take the form of beasts, and
it will be noted in the study of myths that
the gods often assume the forms of birds and
animals. If it were in our power mentally
to become savages for a time, so as to look
upon nature and our surroundings as do the
Blackfeet Indians, or the Patagonians, or the
South Africans, it would be a long step
toward making clear this particular phase of
the question.</p>

<p>From what has been stated, however, the
young student will gain an idea of the meaning
of the word �myth,� which may be
termed a story whose origin can never be
known with certainty. To most people it
has the same significance as a fable, legendary
tale, or fanciful falsehood. A collection
of myths belonging to a particular age
or people is �a mythology,� and the branch
of inquiry which classifies and interprets
them bears the same name.</p>

<p class="newletter"><a name="A" id="A"></a><b>Abas</b> (A&#8242;bas), a son of Meganira, was turned into a newt,
or water-lizard, for deriding the ceremonies
of the Sacrifice.</p>

<p><b>Absyrtus</b> (Absy&#8242;rtus). After Jason had slain the dragon
which guarded the golden fleece, he fled with
Medea, the beautiful young sorceress, and
daughter of Aeetes, who pursued with great
energy, for Medea had taken with her the
most precious treasure of the king, his only
son and heir, Absyrtus. To delay the pursuit,
Medea slew her little brother, cut the
body in pieces, and dropped them over the
side of the vessel. Thus the cruel daughter
effected her escape.</p>

<p><b>Achelous</b> (Achelo&#8242;us) was a river god, and the rival of Hercules
in his love for Deianira. To decide
who should have the bride, Hercules and
Achelous had recourse to a wrestling bout, the
fame of which extends through all the intervening
centuries. In this fierce struggle,
Achelous changed himself into the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
bull and rushed upon his antagonist with
lowered horns, intending to hurl him aside.
Hercules eluded the onset, and seizing one of
the huge horns, held it so firmly that it was
broken off by the furious efforts of Achelous
to free himself. He was defeated, and finally
turned himself into a river, which has since
been known by his name.</p>

<p><b>Acheron</b> (Ach&#8242;eron) (see �The Youth�s Classical Dictionary�).
The current of the river Acheron,
across which all souls had to pass to hear their
decree from Pluto, was so swift that the boldest
swimmer dare not attempt to breast it;
and, since there was no bridge, the spirits
were obliged to rely upon the aid of Charon,
an aged boatman, who plied the only boat
that was available. He would allow no soul
to enter this leaky craft until he had received
the obolus, or fare, which the ancients carefully
placed under the tongue of the dead,
that they might not be delayed in their passage
to Pluto. Those who had not their fare
were forced to wait one hundred years, when
Charon reluctantly ferried them over without
charge.</p>

plunged him, when an infant, into the Stygian
pool, which made him invulnerable wherever
the waters had washed him; but the heel by

<p><b>Aeolus</b> (Aeo&#8242;lus) was the god of the winds. Jupiter was
his reputed father, and his mother is said to
have been a daughter of Hippotus. Aeolus is
represented as having the power of holding
the winds confined in a cavern, and occasionally
giving them liberty to blow over the
world. So much command was he supposed
to have over them that when Ulysses visited
him on his return from Troy he gave him,
tied up in a bag, all the winds that could prevent
his voyage from being prosperous. The
companions of Ulysses, fancying that the bag
contained treasure, cut it open just as they
came in sight of Ithaca, the port they were
making for, and the contrary winds rushing
out drove back the ship many leagues. The

<p><b>Aesculapius</b> (Aescula&#8242;pius), the god of physic, was a son of
Apollo. He was physician to the Argonauts
in their famous expedition to Colchis. He
became so noted for his cures that Pluto became
jealous of him, and he requested Jupiter
to kill him with a thunderbolt. To revenge
his son�s death Apollo slew the Cyclops who
had forged the thunderbolt. By his marriage
with Epione he had two sons, Machaon and
Podalirius, both famous physicians, and four
daughters, of whom Hygeia, the goddess of
health, is the most renowned. Many temples
were erected in honor of Aesculapius, and
votive tablets were hung therein by people
who had been healed by him; but his most
famous shrine was at Epidaurus, where,
every five years, games were held in his
honor. This god is variously represented,
but the most famous statue shows him seated
on a throne of gold and ivory. His head is
crowned with rays, and he wears a long
beard. A knotty stick is in one hand, and a
staff entwined with a serpent is in the other,
while a dog lies at his feet.</p>

<p><b>Altar.</b> A structure on which a sacrifice was
offered. The earliest altars were merely
heaps of earth or turf or rough unhewn stone;
but as the mode of sacrificing became more
ceremonious grander altars were built. Some
were of marble and brass, ornamented with
carvings and bas-reliefs, and the corners with
models of the heads of animals. They varied
in height from two feet to twenty, and some
were built solid; others were made hollow to
retain the blood of the victims. Some were
provided with a kind of dish, into which
frankincense was thrown to overpower the
smell of burning fat. This probably was the
origin of the custom of burning incense at the
altar.</p>

by the following:�Sol (the sun); Cynthius,
from the mountain called Cynthus in

his native place obtained for him the name of
Delius; Delphinius, from his occasionally assuming
the shape of a dolphin. His name of
Delphicus was derived from his connection
with the splendid Temple at Delphi, where
he uttered the famous oracles. Some writers
record that this oracle became dumb when
Jesus Christ was born. Other common names
of Apollo were Didymaeus, Nomius, Paean,
and Phoebus. The Greeks called him Agineus,
because the streets were under his guardianship,
and he was called Pythius from having
killed the serpent Python. Apollo is usually
represented as a handsome young man without
beard, crowned with laurel, and having in
one hand a bow, and in the other a lyre. The

<p>All these tasks he successfully accomplished,
and, besides, he assisted the gods in their
wars with the giants. Several other wonderful
feats are mentioned under other headings,
as Antaeus, Cacus, etc. His death was
brought about through his endeavors to preserve
Deianira from the attacks of Nessus,
the centaur, whom he killed. The centaur,
before he expired, gave his mystic tunic to
Deianira, who in turn gave it to Hercules, and
he put it on, but his doing so brought on an
illness of which he could not be cured. In a
fit of desperation he cast himself into a funeral
pile on Mount Oeta; but Jupiter had him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
taken to heaven in a four-horse chariot, and

<p><b>Janus</b> (Ja&#8242;nus). A king of Italy, said to have been the
son of Coelus, others say of Apollo; he sheltered
Saturn when he was driven from heaven
by Jupiter. Janus presided over highways,
gates, and locks, and is usually represented
with two faces, because he was acquainted
with the past and the future; or, according to
others, because he was taken for the sun, who
opens the day at his rising, and shuts it at his
setting. A brazen temple was erected to him
in Rome, which was always open in time of
war, and closed during peace.</p>

<p><b>Jason</b> (Ja&#8242;son), the son of Aeson, king of Iolcos; he was
brought up by the centaur Chiron. His uncle
Aeeta sent him to fetch the Golden Fleece from
Colchis (see Argonauts). He went in the
ship Argo with forty-nine companions, the
flower of Greek youth. With the help of
Juno they got safe to Colchis, but the King
Aeetes promised to restore the Golden Fleece
only on condition that the Argonauts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
performed certain services. Jason was to tame
the wild fiery bulls, and to make them plow
the field of Mars; to sow in the ground the
teeth of a serpent, from which would spring
armed men who would fight against him who
plowed the field of Mars; to kill the fiery
dragon which guarded the tree on which the
Golden Fleece was hung. The fate of Jason
and the rest of the Argonauts seemed certain;
but Medea, the king�s daughter, fell in love
with Jason, and with the help of charms
which she gave him he overcame all the difficulties
which the king had put in his way.
He took away the Golden Fleece and Medea
also. The king sent his son Absyrtus to overtake
the fugitives, but Medea killed him, and
strewed his limbs in his father�s path, so that
he might be delayed in collecting them, and
this enabled Jason and Medea to escape.
After a time Jason got tired of Medea, and
married Glauce, which cruelty Medea revenged
by killing her children before their
father�s eyes. Jason was accidentally killed
by a beam of the ship Argo falling on him.</p>

Cybele. She was married to Jupiter, and
became queen of all the gods and goddesses,
and mistress of heaven and earth. Juno was
the mother of Mars, Vulcan, Hebe, and Lucina.
She prompted the gods to conspire
against Jupiter, but the attempt was frustrated,
and Apollo and Neptune were banished
from heaven by Jupiter. Juno is the
goddess of marriage, and the protectress of
married women; and she had special regard
for virtuous women. In the competition for
the celebrated Golden Apple, which Juno,
Venus, and Minerva each claimed as the fairest
among the goddesses, Juno was much displeased
when Paris gave the apple to Venus.
The goddess is generally represented riding
in a chariot drawn by peacocks, with a diadem
on her head, and a scepter in her hand.</p>

<p><b>Jupiter</b> (Ju&#8242;piter), son of Saturn and Cybele (or Ops), was
born on Mount Ida, in Crete, and nourished
by the goat Amalthaea. When quite young
Jupiter rescued his father from the Titans;
and afterward, with the help of Hercules,
defeated the giants, the sons of earth, when
they made war against heaven. Jupiter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
worshiped with great solemnity under various
names by most of the heathen nations.
The Africans called him Ammon; the Babylonians,
Belus; and the Egyptians, Osiris
(see Jove). He is represented as a majestic
personage seated on a throne, holding in
his hands a scepter and a thunderbolt; at his
feet stood a spread eagle.</p>

<p><b>Neptune</b> (Nep&#8242;tune), god of the sea, was a son of Saturn and

not consider that the dominion of the sea was
equal to Jupiter�s empire of heaven and

holds in his hand a trident, with which he
rules the waves. Though a marine deity, he
was reputed to have presided over horse-training
and horse-races; but he is principally
known as the god of the ocean; and the
two functions of the god are portrayed in the

<p><b>Pan.</b> The Arcadian god of shepherds, huntsmen,

deities, is usually considered to have
been the son of Mercury and Penelope. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
his birth he was metamorphosed into the
mythical form in which we find him depicted,
namely, a horned, long-eared man, with the
lower half of the body like a goat. He is
generally seen playing a pipe made of reeds
of various lengths, which he invented himself,
and from which he could produce music
which charmed even the gods. These are
the Pan-pipes, or <i>Syrinx</i>. Pan�s terrific appearance
once so frightened the Gauls when
they invaded Greece that they ran away
though no one pursued them; and the word
<i>panic</i> is said to have been derived from this
episode. The Fauns, who greatly resembled
Pan, were his attendants.</p>

by Apollo, and Mercury taught her oratory.
Jupiter gave her a box, the famous �Pandora�s
Box,� which she was told to give to her
husband, Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus.
As soon as he opened it there issued from it
numberless diseases and evils which were
soon spread all over the world, and from that
moment they have afflicted the human race.

<p><b>Paris</b> (Par&#8242;is), the son of Priam, king of Troy, and of his
mother Hecuba. It had been predicted
that he would be the cause of the destruction
of Troy, and his father therefore ordered him
to be strangled as soon as he was born; but
the slave who had been entrusted with this
mission took the child to Mount Ida, and left
it there. Some shepherds, however, found
the infant and took care of him. He lived
among them till he had grown to man�s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
estate, and he then married Oenone, a nymph
of Ida. At the famous nuptial feast of Peleus
and Thetis, Discordia, who had not been invited,
attended secretly; and when all were
assembled, she threw among the goddesses
a golden apple, on which was inscribed �Let
the fairest take it.� This occasioned a great
contention, for each thought herself the fairest.
Ultimately, the contestants were reduced
to three, Juno, Pallas (Minerva), and Venus;
but Jove himself could not make these three
agree, and it was decided that Paris should
be the umpire. He was sent for, and each of
the goddesses courted his favor by offering
all sorts of bribes. Juno offered him power,
Pallas wisdom, and Venus promised him the
most beautiful woman in the world. Paris
gave the golden apple to Venus. Soon after
this episode Priam owned Paris as his son,
and sent him to Greece to fetch Helen, who
was renowned as being the most beautiful
woman in the world. She was the wife of
Menelaus, king of Sparta; but during his absence
Paris carried Helen away to Troy, and
this gave rise to the celebrated war between
the Greeks and the Trojans, which ended in
the destruction of Troy. Paris was among
the 676,000 Trojans who fell during or after
the siege.</p>

saw Andromeda chained to the rock, and a
sea-monster ready to devour her. He killed
the monster, and married Andromeda. When

<p class="newletter"><a name="S" id="S"></a><b>Sacrifices</b> were ceremonious offerings made to
the gods. To every deity a distinct victim
was allotted, and the greatest care was always
taken in the selection of them. Anything
in any way blemished was considered
as an insult to the god. At the time of the
sacrifice the people were called together by
heralds led by a procession of musicians.
The priest, clothed in white, was crowned
with a wreath made of the leaves of the tree
which was sacred to the particular god to
whom the sacrifice was offered. The victim
had its horns gilt, and was adorned with a
chaplet similar to that of the priest, and was
decorated with bright-colored ribbons. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
priest then said, �Who is here?� to which
the spectators replied, �Many good people.�
�Begone all ye who are profane,� said the
priest; and he then began a prayer addressed
to all the gods. The sacrifice was begun by
putting corn, frankincense, flour, salt, cakes,
and fruit on the head of the victim. This
was called the Immolation. The priest then
took a cup of wine, tasted it, and handed it
to the bystanders to taste also; some of it
was then poured between the horns of the
victim, and a few of the saturated hairs were
pulled off and put in the fire which was burning
on the altar. Then, turning to the east,
the priest drew with his knife a crooked line
along the back of the beast from the head to
the tail, and told the assistants to kill the
animal. This was done directly, and the entrails
of the victim taken out and carefully
examined by the Haruspices to find out what
was prognosticated. The carcase was then
divided, and the thighs, covered with fat,
were put in the fire, and the rest of the animal
was cut up, cooked, and eaten. This
feast was celebrated with dancing, music,
and hymns, in praise of the god in whose
honor the sacrifice was made. On great occasions
as many as a hundred bullocks were
offered at one time; and it is said that Pythagoras
made this offering when he found out
the demonstration of the forty-seventh proposition
of the book of Euclid.</p>

<p><b>Ulysses</b> (Ulys&#8242;ses). A noted king of Ithaca, whose exploits
in connection with the Trojan war, and his
adventures on his return therefrom, are the
subject of Homer�s Odyssey. His wife�s
name was Penelope, and he was so much endeared
to her that he feigned madness to get
himself excused from going to the Trojan
war; but this artifice was discovered, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
was compelled to go. He was of great help
to the Grecians, and forced Achilles from his
retreat, and obtained the charmed arrows of
Hercules from Philoctetes, and used them
against the Trojans. He enabled Paris to
shoot one of them at the heel of Achilles, and
so kill that charmed warrior. During his
wanderings on his homeward voyage he was
taken prisoner by the Cyclopes and escaped,
after blinding Polyphemus, their chief. At
Aeolia he obtained all the winds of heaven,
and put them in a bag; but his companions,
thinking that the bags contained treasure
which they could rob him of when they got to
Ithaca, cut the bags, and let out the winds,
and the ships were immediately blown back
to Aeolia. After Circe had turned his companions
into swine on an island where he and
they were shipwrecked, he compelled the goddess
to restore them to their human shape
again. As he passed the islands of the Sirens
he escaped their allurements by stopping the
ears of his companions with wax, and fastening
himself to the mast of his ship. His wife
Penelope was a pattern of constancy; for,
though Ulysses was reported to be dead, she
would not marry any one else, and had the
satisfaction of finding her husband return
after an absence of about twenty years. The
Greek name of Ulysses is Odysseus.</p>

<p><b>Unknown God, An.</b> With reference to this God,
nothing can be more appropriate than St.
Paul�s address to the Athenians, as recorded
in the 17th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>�<i>Ye</i> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are
too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your
devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, <small>TO THE
UNKNOWN GOD</small>. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
him declare I unto you. God that made the world and
all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and
earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither
is worshiped with men�s hands, as though he needed anything,
seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men for
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
that they should seek the Lord, if haply they
might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far
from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and
have our being; as certain also of your own poets have
said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as
we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that
the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man�s device. And the times of this ignorance
God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere
to repent: because he hath appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in righteousness by
<em>that</em> man whom he hath ordained; <em>whereof</em> he hath given
assurance unto all <em>men</em>, in that he hath raised him from
the dead.�</p>

the attentions of others of the gods,
and notably of Mars, their offspring being
Hermione, Cupid, and Anteros. After this
she left Olympus and fell in love with Adonis,
a beautiful youth, who was killed when hunting

<p class="centerpadt"><b>BOOKS BY RALCY HUSTED BELL</b></p>


<p class="centerlrg"><b>The Worth of Words</b></p>

<p class="center"><i>Third Edition, Revised and Enlarged.</i></p>

<p>The <small>SOULS</small> of words live after their forms change.
This spiritual element of words survives as literature.
The <em>living</em> book contains the <small>EGO</small> of the author�the
spiritual personality of his mind. This book treats of
the <em>right</em> usage of words on this vital basis. It is a
<em>living</em> guide. Simple and clear, it aids correct speech
and shows how to vitalize words with <small>SOUL</small>.</p>


<p class="centerlrg"><b>The Changing Values of English Speech</b></p>

<p>A mate to <small>THE WORTH OF WORDS</small>. Touches
lightly the philosophical side in a <em>practical</em> way: illumines
<i>Style</i>, <i>Soul of Words</i>, <i>Early English</i>, <i>Language Change</i>,
<i>Poetry</i>, <i>Syntax</i>, <i>Variations in Word-Meanings</i>, <i>Distinctions</i>,
<i>Origin of Language</i>, <i>Old Celtic Friends</i>, <i>English Orthography</i>,
<i>Words Changed Since Shakespeare</i>, <i>Commonplace
Poetry</i>, <i>Aborigines</i>. Reads with the <em>fascination of romance</em>.</p>


<p class="centerlrg"><b>The Religion of Beauty</b></p>

<p class="center"><i>Second Edition, Revised and Enlarged.</i></p>

<p>This is the autobiography of a Soul glad of life�one
who finds riches in the possessions of others and, above
all, a golden wealth in man�s <em>Impersonal Estate</em>�in <small>SKY</small>
and <small>STAR</small>, <small>SUN</small> and <small>CITY</small>, the <small>SEA</small> and the <small>OPEN WORLD</small>�one
who finds the <em>Religion</em> of <em>Beauty</em> in all things, and
reveals the secret whereby all who will may dig up
�real wealth� while having a good time.</p>


<p class="centerlrg"><b>Taormina</b></p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated. New Historic Matter.</i></p>

<p class="padbase">History is told here with Maeterlinck�s charm of style;
scenes are painted with the power and beauty of Hearn;
philosophy is unconsciously brought forth from events.
Greek legend weaves a necklace of imagery which holds
<small>ETNA</small> in its clasp. Martial echoes mingle with the voices
of ancient poets, the murmur of the Ionian Sea and of
olive leaves in sunny Sicily.</p>


<p class="centervlrg"><b>English and American Literature</b></p>

<p class="centerlrg"><b>A One Year Course<br>
<span class="vsmlfont">FROM CHAUCER TO MARK TWAIN</span></b></p>

<p class="center">By B. A. HEYDRICK, A. B.<br>
<br>
<span class="vsmlfont">DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH, HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE<br>
NEW YORK CITY</span></p>


<p>Interestingly written, illustrated with portraits and
enlivened by pictures of scenes described, facsimiles of
manuscripts, etc.</p>

<p>In the space of three hundred pages the author has
managed to give a clear account of English literature
from Chaucer to Mark Twain and James Whitcomb
Riley. It is <em>not</em> a mere outline, but a continuous narrative,
and really the most engaging book on the subject
that has appeared. It is written on a different plan
from most brief text-books. The author has wisely not
attempted to treat every author in English literature.
By omitting the names which have no meaning for us
to-day the author has gained space to treat the really
significant writers quite fully enough for the needs of
young students. An excellent feature of the book is
the profusion of <em>illustrations</em>. Throughout the work
emphasis is placed upon books that <em>still live</em>. The
nineteenth century in particular is treated fully; the
writers may be no greater than those of the eighteenth,
but they have more to say to us.</p>

<p class="padbase">Each chapter is followed by a list of recommended
reading in the chief authors, with references to volumes
where these may be found. By means of this recommended
reading <em>the course covered by this book may
readily be extended to cover two years� work</em>, or more.
Under each chief author is mentioned a standard library
edition of his works and inexpensive editions of
single volumes.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
